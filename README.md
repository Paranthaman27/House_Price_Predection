# House_Price_Predection
This project predicts house prices using Linear Regression with both numerical (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking) and categorical features (mainroad, guestroom, furnishing). Data is cleaned and encoded, model trained, evaluated with MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², and visualized for performance insights.

This project predicts house prices using Linear Regression. The dataset includes both numerical features (like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking) and categorical features (such as mainroad access, guestroom availability, furnishing status, etc.). 

The data is first cleaned and categorical variables are converted into numerical form using one-hot encoding. After preprocessing, a Linear Regression model is trained and tested to evaluate how different factors affect house price. 

The model is assessed using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score, and visualizations like Actual vs Predicted prices and Residual plots help understand model performance. 

The outcome is a simple but powerful regression model that shows how property attributes contribute to price prediction.
